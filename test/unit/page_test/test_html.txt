<P>Project participants require a common understanding of a project to cooperative effectively. Without a common understanding among project participants disorder sets in because they cannot align their interests and will work at cross purposes to one another. </P>
<P>Therefore be proactive communicating and sharing information with project participants and do not assume everyone will just find what they need to know or has the same understanding of the project as everyone else. Use work products such as the vision and requirements to align the understanding of the stake holders and developers. Use the architecture to focus and align the interests of the developers.

<H4>Foster a High Trust Environment </H4>
<P>People who do not feel safe will not communicate their ideas, take the initiative, or admit their ignorance. This leads to work environments where actions must be laboriously and expensively negotiated and work which must be carefully monitored and audited. </P>

<H4>Share Responsibility<BR></H4>
<P>When a person works alone communications can stop and they can �go dark� Their understanding of the project may become misaligned with the rest of the team.

<P>Therefore, while project participants have primary responsibility for their work products, responsibility for work products is shared. Nothing is someone else�s job.

Experienced staff should be extra vigilant and watch over less experienced staff encouraging them to ask for help if necessary. </P>
<P>The&nbsp;collaborative practice Foster a High Trust Environment reinforces sharing responsibility by making it safe for people to take the initiative, or to admit their ignorance. </P>
<H4>Learn Continuously </H4>
<P>Not only is software development a fast developing field where technical skills rapidly become obsolescent, it is also an experimental field where software is developed often by a process that resembles trial and error. Furthermore, software is developed by teams of people. </P>
<P>Therefore continuously develop both your technical and interpersonal skills. Learn from the examples of your colleagues. Take the opportunity to be both a student and a teacher to your colleagues.

    The project manager needs to regularly assess the results as planned. For example, in iterative development, this will
    be done at the end of each iteration. Even if&nbsp;he or she is not&nbsp;using iterative development, the manager
    should define quantifiable goals for a given period to facilitate regular assessment of the project's progress.
</p>
<p>
    Below&nbsp;are questions that project managers can ask themselves and the rest of the team to help know the project
    status:

                <li>
                    Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the release meet performance and capacity
                    goals?

            What portion of the current release will be baselined? What portion will need to be reworked?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have new risks been identified?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have there been external changes such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the

    One very important aspect of project assessment is to base the assessments on objective measures, as much as it is
    possible to do so. For example, to assess that a given requirement is developed, the project manager must check that
    the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it, rather than considering it done when the implementation
    is done.

    Assessing the results is also a good opportunity to get feedback from the stakeholders.

    This feedback can be gathered through ways such as giving stakeholders informal demonstrations of what's developed as

    the project progress and sending partial deliveries to stakeholders. However the feedback is gathered, it is good to
    record changes that could have an impact on the project's scope or duration.

    This step is optional and must be performed only when the assessed period coincide with the end of a phase.
</p>
<p>
    The end of&nbsp;a phase represents a point of synchronization of technical and management expectations and closure for
    a project. In iterative development, it coincides&nbsp;with the end of an iteration. However, phase ends mark a point
    when it is possible to consider re-scoping and even re-contracting a project. For example, the inception phase is
    exploratory and may be appropriately performed under a time-and-materials contract or a cost-plus type of contract. The
    elaboration phase could be done as a fixed-price contract or a cost-plus contract, depending on the extent to which the
    development is unusual. By the construction and transition phases, enough is known about the system that fixed-price
    contracts are more appealing to the acquirer and vendor.
</p>
<p>
    The phase end is marked by a major milestone and a corresponding milestone review. The degree of formality of
    these&nbsp;reviews depends on the project. The important thing is to take advantage&nbsp;of this milestone review to
    achieve agreement among all stakeholders on the current state of the project. For more information, refer to <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/milestones,_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">Concept: Milestones</a>.

<p>
    J2EE supports a number of <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../rup_j2ee_plug_in/guidances/concepts/j2ee_deployment_configurations,7.671163061311939E-306.html" guid="7.671163061311939E-306">J2EE Deployment Configurations</a>.&nbsp;Selecting&nbsp;a particular deployment
    configuration is an important step in Architectural Analysis as it becomes the foundation on which the initial
    architecture is based.
</p>
<p>
    Selecting a J2EE deployment configuration drives the definition of the initial <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../rup/workproducts/rup_deployment_model,{5981B6BE-2FD1-4984-AA94-2F7428439BA6}.html" guid="{5981B6BE-2FD1-4984-AA94-2F7428439BA6}">Deployment Model</a>.&nbsp;The selected J2EE deployment configuration
    defines the configuration of physical nodes (that is, machines) and logical nodes (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../rup_j2ee_plug_in/guidances/concepts/java_2_platform_enterprise_edition_j2ee_overview,1.527482214591853E-307.html" guid="1.527482214591853E-307">J2EE containers</a>).&nbsp;This is where you decide whether or not you have a separate
    Web server and an EJB server, and whether your clients are browsers using HTTP or are fat application clients.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these deployment configurations exhibits different characteristics, so one should be selected based upon a
    number of factors. Some factors that should be considered when selecting a deployment configuration include:
    maintainability (how do you isolate changes in one tier so they don't affect other tiers, how easy is it to deploy
    upgrades?), performance and scalability (how easy is it to add additional computing resources?), and reliability (what
    happens if one of the resources goes down?).
</p>
<p>
    The selection of a deployment configuration constrains a number of other architectural decisions regarding the
    architectural mechanisms that must be defined, the application's concurrency (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../rup/tasks/describe_runtime_architecture,{4D35C038-A2D0-48B8-9ECD-52717FEAE33A}.html" guid="{4D35C038-A2D0-48B8-9ECD-52717FEAE33A}">Task: Describe the Run-time Architecture</a>), and the application's

                <h3>Collaborate to align interests and share understanding</h3>

                <p>Software is created by people with different interests and skills who must work together to create software effectively. Therefore develop collaborative practices that foster a healthy team environment. Good collaborative practices align the interests of project participants (e.g. development team, quality assurance, product stakeholders, customers) and help project participants develop a shared understanding of the project.</p>

                <h3>Practices</h3>

                <h4>Maintain a Common Understanding</h4>

                <p>Project participants require a common understanding of a project to cooperative effectively. Without a common understanding among project participants disorder sets in because they cannot align their interests and will work at cross purposes to one another.</p>

                <p>Therefore be proactive communicating and sharing information with project participants and do not assume everyone will just find what they need to know or has the same understanding of the project as everyone else. Use work products such as the vision and requirements to align the understanding of the stake holders and developers. Use the architecture to focus and align the interests of the developers. At the end of each iteration get agreement iteration goals have been reached and if not then what remedial actions must be taken.</p>The 

                <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./resources/core_principle_focus,_9gocwMvoEdqukPpotm3DYg.html" guid="_9gocwMvoEdqukPpotm3DYg">Focus</a>&nbsp;principle helps to maintain a common understanding.

                <br />

                <h4>Foster a High Trust Environment</h4>

                <p>People who do not feel safe will not communicate their ideas, take the initiative, or admit their ignorance. This leads to work environments where actions must be laboriously and expensively negotiated and work which must be carefully monitored and audited.</p>

                <p>Therefore take actions that will foster a high trust environment:</p>

                <ul>

                  <li>Manage by intent - create an environment where teams manage themselves and managers mentor teams to complete their objectives.</li>

                  <li>Tear down the walls &ndash; work to remove both the physical and mental barriers that inhibit development of a common understanding between project participants.</li>

                  <li>Walk mile (or a kilometer and a half) in someone else&rsquo;s shoes &ndash; respect and try to understand the perspective of others before criticizing their ideas or responding to their criticism.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Share Responsibility

                <br /></h4>

                <p>When a person works alone communications can stop and they can &ldquo;go dark&rdquo; Their understanding of the project may become misaligned with the rest of the team. They may get into trouble and not ask for help, or not realize the team is in trouble. In the worse situations trust breaks down as people see the team working at cross purposes to their interests.</p>

                <p>Therefore, while project participants have primary responsibility for their work products, responsibility for work products is shared. Nothing is someone else&rsquo;s job. It may mean either taking up slack and working with someone who&rsquo;s lagging for some reason or asking for help. Experienced staff should be extra vigilant and watch over less experienced staff encouraging them to ask for help if necessary.</p>

                <p>The&nbsp;collaborative practice Foster a High Trust Environment reinforces sharing responsibility by making it safe for people to take the initiative, or to admit their ignorance.</p>

                <h4>Learn Continuously</h4>

                <p>Not only is software development a fast developing field where technical skills rapidly become obsolescent, it is also an experimental field where software is developed often by a process that resembles trial and error. Furthermore, software is developed by teams of people.</p>

                <p>Therefore continuously develop both your technical and interpersonal skills. Learn from the examples of your colleagues.

However, be watchful that individuals and teams organized this way do not form a "silo" mentality where they focus striclty on their sub-systems and become ignorant of the other subsystems.</p>

    The project manager needs to regularly assess the results as planned. For example, in iterative development, this will
    be done at the end of each iteration. Even if&nbsp;he or she is not&nbsp;using iterative development, the manager
    should define quantifiable goals for a given period to facilitate regular assessment of the project's progress.
</p>
<p>
    Below&nbsp;are questions that project managers can ask themselves and the rest of the team to help know the project
    status:

                <li>
                    Were risks reduced or eliminated?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the release meet performance and capacity
                    goals?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Are changes to the project plan required?
        </li>
        <li>
            What portion of the current release will be baselined? What portion will need to be reworked?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have new risks been identified?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have there been external changes such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the
            requirements?
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    One very important aspect of project assessment is to base the assessments on objective measures, as much as it is
    possible to do so. For example, to assess that a given requirement is developed, the project manager must check that
    the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it, rather than considering it done when the implementation
    is done.

    Assessing the results is also a good opportunity to get feedback from the stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    This feedback can be gathered through ways such as giving stakeholders informal demonstrations of what's developed as

    the project progress and sending partial deliveries to stakeholders. However the feedback is gathered, it is good to
    record changes that could have an impact on the project's scope or duration.

    Depending on the result assessment and the stakeholders' feedback, the project manager could need to revise the project
    plan to adapt to those changes. If a change affects defined project milestones, the project manager should consult with
    the stakeholders before committing to the changes.

    Necessary changes can also encompass the need to acquire new resources, to absorb an unplanned effort increase, or be
    something specialized able to implement a specific change request.

    This step is optional and must be performed only when the assessed period coincide with the end of a phase.
</p>
<p>
    The end of&nbsp;a phase represents a point of synchronization of technical and management expectations and closure for
    a project. In iterative development, it coincides&nbsp;with the end of an iteration. However, phase ends mark a point
    when it is possible to consider re-scoping and even re-contracting a project. For example, the inception phase is
    exploratory and may be appropriately performed under a time-and-materials contract or a cost-plus type of contract. The
    elaboration phase could be done as a fixed-price contract or a cost-plus contract, depending on the extent to which the
    development is unusual. By the construction and transition phases, enough is known about the system that fixed-price
    contracts are more appealing to the acquirer and vendor.
</p>
<p>
    The phase end is marked by a major milestone and a corresponding milestone review. The degree of formality of
    these&nbsp;reviews depends on the project. The important thing is to take advantage&nbsp;of this milestone review to
    achieve agreement among all stakeholders on the current state of the project. For more information, refer to <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/milestones,_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">Concept: Milestones</a>.
